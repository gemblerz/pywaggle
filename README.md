# Waggle Python Module

This module provides abstractions which simplify the design of scripts and
plugins running on the [Waggle platform](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/waggle).

## Installation

This module is developed for Python 3. It _may_ work fine with Python 2,
but we don't specifically aim to support this.

If you have both Python 2 and 3 installed, you may specify `pip3` rather than
`pip` when following the steps below.

### Installing from Github

```
pip install git+https://github.com/waggle-sensor/pywaggle
```

### Installing from local repo

```
git clone https://github.com/waggle-sensor/pywaggle
cd pywaggle
pip install .
```
