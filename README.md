# Waggle Python Module

This module provides abstractions which simplify the design of scripts and
plugins running on the [Waggle platform](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/waggle).

This module is written with Python 3 in mind. It _may_ work fine with Python 2,
but we don't specifically aim to support this.
